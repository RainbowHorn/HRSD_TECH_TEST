This test case do not anticipate that trainline.fr page returns different layouts, so there is no
language change in it.

1. As a user, I open 'trainline.fr' page
2. As a user, I fill search form and submit it with this values:
    -   'Paris' for Départ
    -   'Angers' for Arrivée
    -   '25 décembre 16:00' for Aller
3. As a user, I check that result page contain train for 04:30 PM (16h30) from MONTPARNASSE 1 ET 2 to ANGERS
    SAINT LAUD at 6:30PM (18h30)
