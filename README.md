This is a repository for tests for a test exercises.

You can find a test cases in 'Test cases' folder.

In order to run tests, first install libraries locally from `package.json`.
Then run `npx nightwatch tests/`. One of the test (from `trainline.js`) should fall because there is no train at expected time.
